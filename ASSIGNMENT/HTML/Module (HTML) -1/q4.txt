Q4 What are HTML Entities? 
>> HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a reserved meaning in HTML or characters that are not easily typed on a keyboard. They are particularly useful for displaying special symbols, reserved characters, or non-ASCII characters in a web page.

Why HTML Entities Are Used:
Reserved Characters: Some characters have special meanings in HTML, like <, >, &, and ". To display these characters as part of the content rather than HTML code, you use HTML entities.
Special Symbols: To display characters that are not available on a standard keyboard, like ©, ®, ™, or €.
Non-ASCII Characters: To represent characters from other languages or special typographic symbols.
