Q10 .How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML 
table? 
>> In HTML tables, you can merge multiple rows or columns into a single row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes. These attributes allow you to combine cells across rows or columns, respectively.

1. Merging Columns (colspan Attribute)
The colspan attribute specifies the number of columns a cell should span across. This is useful when you want a cell to cover more than one column.

2. Merging Rows (rowspan Attribute)
The rowspan attribute specifies the number of rows a cell should span across. This is useful when you want a cell to cover more than one row.
