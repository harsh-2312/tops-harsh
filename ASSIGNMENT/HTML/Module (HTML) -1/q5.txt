Q5 What are different types of lists in HTML?

An ordered list is used when the order of the list items matters. The items are numbered automatically by the browser.

>> 2. Unordered List (<ul>)
An unordered list is used when the order of the items is not important. The items are marked with bullets by default.

>> 3. Definition List (<dl>)
A definition list is used to create a list of terms and their corresponding definitions. Itâ€™s useful for glossaries, descriptions, or any list where items have descriptions.
